# Jokinator Website
This is a simple web application that uses flask to manage the backend, which I created for my applications of programming principles during my first year of studies. It displays a random joke chosen from a JSON file of preset jokes each time the page is loaded, as well users can add and delete their jokes which are being stored within a JSON file.
